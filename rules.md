# X-Team 126 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will communicate efficiently between members in order to assign and reassign tasks. 
To make sure all team members contribute to this project, we are going to assign small parts of the project to each member, and will meet up together to check the process.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
First, we will contact each other through team-chat to check whether each member is doing their own part during weekdays. Then, we will schedule with all members to meet up during sometime on weekend to follow up each members' tasks and implement the parts that are not finished or parts that need help. 

## How will you communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

First, if any of our team members struggle with the task that was given, then they will bring that task on the table for discussion and brain-stroming. After that, we collectively try to solve the problem. If that does not help, we try researching online, or books. And if that does not help, we go knock the doors of the TA.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We announce to the group that if we submit an assingment, that it has been completed and if there is a deadline is coming up and the assignment is not completed then we can message the group. Also, we can also explore other online tools to communicate efficently such as git and social media. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Be respectful of your group members time and inform in advance if you cannot make it to any of the meetings.
